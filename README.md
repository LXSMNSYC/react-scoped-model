> Scoped Model pattern in React (but with Hooks)

[![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@lxsmnsyc/react-scoped-model.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lxsmnsyc/react-scoped-model) [![JavaScript Style Guide](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](https://standardjs.com)

## Install

```bash
npm install --save @lxsmnsyc/react-scoped-model
```

## Usage

### Creating your Model

Models are created by using a hook function that is always called whenever its Provider renders, and must return an object that represents the models' state:

```jsx
// import the createModel function
import createModel from '@lxsmnsyc/react-scoped-model';

// some hooks that we will need
import { useState, useCallback } from 'react';

/**
 * One of the basic models for state management, a model that has two actions:
 * - Increment = Adds 1 to count.
 * - Decrement = Subtracts 1 to count.
 */
const Counter = createModel(function () {
  // The state of our model
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  // An action for our model
  const increment = useCallback(() => {
    // update the state by getting the current state, adding 1
    setCount(c => c + 1);
  }, []); // No dependencies means no new instances every update.

  // Another action
  const decrement = useCallback(() => {
    // update the state by getting the current state, subtracting 1
    setCount(c => c - 1);
  }, []);

  // Return the shape of our model
  return {
    count,
    increment,
    decrement,
  };
});

export default Counter;
```

### Adding to your component tree

To add the Model to your component tree, simply use the `Provider` component property:

```jsx
export default function App() {
  return (
    <Counter.Provider>
      <Count />
      <Increment />
      <Decrement />
    </Counter.Provider>
  );
}
```

### useProperty Hook

To access the property of the provided scoped Model, you need to use the `useProperty` function from your Model instance. This function accesses the property as well as listens to the property changes, re-rendering the component.

You can also provide a boolean value to the second argument which tells the hook if it needs to listen for the changes (defaults to true).

```jsx
function Count() {
  const count = Counter.useProperty('count');

  return (
    <h1>Count: {count}</h1>
  );
}
```

```jsx
function Increment() {
  const increment = Counter.useProperty('increment');

  return (
    <button type="button" onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
  );
}
```

```jsx
function Decrement() {
  const decrement = Counter.useProperty('decrement');

  return (
    <button type="button" onClick={decrement}>Decrement</button>
  );
}
```

In our Counter app, only the Count component re-renders whenever any of the Model actions are called.

To listen for multiple properties, you can use `.useProperties(keys: string[], listen: boolean)` function, which returns the values of the properties in an array.

```jsx
function IncDec() {
  const [increment, decrement] = Counter.useProperties(['increment', 'decrement']);
  return (
    <React.Fragment>
      <button type="button" onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
      <button type="button" onClick={decrement}>Decrement</button>
    </React.Fragment>
  );
}
```

### Selectors

If the model's shape is complex (e.g. deeply nested) and/or you only want to listen to specific changes e.g. transforming a value, you can use the `useSelector` and `useSelectors` hook to listen to your transformed state value.

```jsx
function Count() {
  const count = Counter.useSelector(state => state.count);

  return (
    <h1>Count: {count}</h1>
  );
}
```

### Props

A model can also receive props:

```jsx
const MyModel = createModel(({ initialValue }) => /* code */);
```

```jsx
<MyModel.Provider initialValue="Hello World">
 ...
</MyModel.Provider>
```

### Options

A model can also receive an option:

```jsx
const MyModel = createModel(myHook, {
  displayName: 'MyModel',
});
```

Useful for inspecting your model with React DevTools, as well as receive expressive errors whenever
you try to use the scoped model hooks assuming that the model is mounted to the component tree.

The option can also have `propTypes` and `defaultProps` from the `prop-types` module.

### Shadowing Context

The concept of Scoped Model is that, unlike the Global state which all components have access to the state, Scoped Models only allows access within its component tree, this is comparable as to how "global variables vs local variables" work.

However, if we use the same Provider within the same tree, the model instance will be shadowed, which is similar to how scoped-based variables in JavaScript work:

```js
let x = 10;
if (true) {
  let x = 20;
  console.log('Shadowed X: ', x); // Shadowed X: 20
}
if (true) {
  console.log('Unshadowed X: ', x); // Unshadowed X: 10
}
console.log('Same-level X:', x); // Same-level X: 10
```

## Migrating from 0.1.0

The initial version of this package used to have the `useModelState` and `useModelAction` hooks, as well as the model hook needs to return the proper model shape.

To update, simply replace `useModelState` and `useModelAction` with the `useProperty` hook, providing the property key you wanted to listen to, as well as remove the object deconstruction.

The motivation for the API change is due to the Context API's observedBits instability, as well as fine-grained property access for a much reasonable and accurate component re-render.

## Comparison to other Context-based State Libraries

### [Constate](https://github.com/diegohaz/constate)

A very similar library, although the problem here is that it is more of a wrapper to the existing Context API, as well as it performs the default comparison to the provided value, thus giving the Consumers of the value an unreasonable re-render if the returned value changes.

In react-scoped-model, Consumers can choose to listen for either the state changes or the action changes, giving a more reasonable re-render.

### [Provider](https://github.com/LXSMNSYC/react-provider)

The twin library of this package, both inspired by Flutter patterns. The difference here is that Provider is of general purpose depedency injection, as well as react-scoped-model allows the use of Hooks for reusable logic. react-scoped-model also employs a createContext-like approach (similar to constate).
